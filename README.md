# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

In C programming, stacks and queues are commonly used data structures.

A stack is a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure. It follows the principle that the last element inserted is the first one to be removed. In C, you can implement a stack using an array or a linked list. The key operations for a stack include push (to insert an element) and pop (to remove the top element).

A queue, on the other hand, is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. It follows the principle that the first element inserted is the first one to be removed. In C, you can implement a queue using an array or a linked list. The primary operations for a queue include enqueue (to insert an element) and dequeue (to remove the front element).
